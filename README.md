FluentValidation
Swagger (for API documentation)

# ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

The project structure follows the recommended pattern for DDD:

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain/         # Entities, Value Objects, and Repository Interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ Application/    # Use Cases, Application Services, and DTOs
â”œâ”€â”€ Infrastructure/ # Repository Implementations, Database Configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ API/            # Controllers, Middleware Configurations, and Routes
â””â”€â”€ Tests/          # Unit and Integration Tests

Main Components
Domain: Responsible for representing business rules and domain concepts.
Application: Orchestrates use cases and handles communication between the domain and infrastructure.
Infrastructure: Implements technical details such as data persistence and external API integration.
API: Entry point for system communication.
